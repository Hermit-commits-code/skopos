Proactive supply-chain defense for the modern Python ecosystem.

forensic analysis of PyPI packages and metadata. It detects typosquatting,
reputation anomalies, account hijackings (resurrection attacks), and
malicious payloads before they ever reach your local environment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🔍 Instant Audit

Analyze a package instantly using `uvx`:

```bash
uvx skopos check <package_name>
```

### 🛠️ Permanent Protection

Install Skopos and enable shell hooks to automatically intercept `uv` and
`pip` commands:

```bash
pip install skopos
skopos --install-hook
```

Once installed, running `uv add <package>` (or other wrapped commands) will
trigger a Skopos audit. If a package is flagged, the installation is blocked
until you manually authorize it.

## 📦 Installation & System Footprint

Skopos maintains a minimal and predictable footprint on the host system.

1. Software installation

   Installed via `pip` (or `uv`) into your environment's site-packages:

   ```text
   Path: .venv/lib/python3.x/site-packages/skopos/
   ```

2. Local configuration & data

   Skopos stores state and persistent data under the user's home directory:
   - `Directory: ~/.skopos/`
   - `audit_cache.db`: a local SQLite database storing forensic scores for
     24 hours to optimize performance.
   - `~/.skopos-whitelist`: a list of authorized packages.
   - `~/.skopos-whitelist.sig`: a SHA-256 signature file ensuring whitelist
     integrity against unauthorized tampering.

3. Shell interception

   Running `skopos --install-hook` appends a lightweight wrapper to your shell
   profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`). The wrapper invokes Skopos to verify
   package safety before allowing `uv add` / `pip install` to proceed.

## 🧠 Forensic Capabilities (v0.22)

Skopos uses a weighted 0–100 Security Score to evaluate risk and includes:

- **Typosquatting Detection** — Uses Levenshtein distance to catch look-alike
  packages (e.g., `reqests` vs `requests`).
- **Giant's Immunity** — Recognizes high-reputation projects (e.g., pandas,
  numpy) to reduce false positives for established infrastructure.
- **Resurrection Tracking** — Flags dormant accounts that suddenly push
  updates after years of inactivity (possible account hijacking).
- **Bot-Inflation Protection** — Detects "social proof" attacks where
  download counts are artificially inflated on new packages.
- **Sandboxed Execution** — Safely evaluates metadata and script snippets in
  a restricted environment.

## 🛠️ Usage & Administration

Common commands:

```bash
skopos audit              # Scan the current project's pyproject.toml
skopos check <package>    # Perform a deep forensic scan on a specific package
skopos --install-hook     # Inject security wrappers into ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
skopos --disable          # Remove shell interceptions and restore defaults
skopos -r --max-depth 2   # Perform a recursive audit of a dependency tree
```

## 🛡️ Trust & Whitelisting

Skopos maintains a cryptographically signed whitelist at `~/.skopos-whitelist`.

- If a package is flagged during an audit, you can choose to trust it locally
  by adding it to the whitelist.
- The whitelist is signed using a SHA-256 hash to prevent unauthorized
  tampering.

## 📂 Project Structure

For developers and auditors, the codebase follows a consolidated, modular
architecture:

```text
skopos/
├── pyproject.toml         # Project metadata and entry points
├── src/
│   └── skopos/            # Source root
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── checker.py     # Main CLI & whitelist management
│       ├── checker_logic.py # Forensic heuristics & scoring
│       ├── cache.py       # SQLite cache manager
│       └── sandbox.py     # Restricted execution environment
└── CASE_STUDY.md          # Technical deep-dive on threat models
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Future Ideas

Skopos is evolving from a local utility into a comprehensive security framework.

### v0.23: The Intelligence Layer

- **Shared Threat Intelligence**: Optional opt-in to report malicious package hashes to a centralized community database.
- **Enhanced Sandboxing**: Moving beyond `RestrictedPython` to lightweight WASM-based execution for deeper script analysis.

### v1.0: Enterprise Governance

- **GitOps Policy Sync**: Ability to fetch signed whitelists from a central repository for team-wide security parity.
- **CI/CD Gating**: Dedicated GitHub Actions and GitLab CI components to block builds containing low-score dependencies.
- **Detailed Forensic Exports**: Support for SARIF and JSON reporting for integration into SOC/SIEM platforms.- **Detailed Forensic Exports**: Support for SARIF and JSON reporting for integration into SOC/SIEM platforms.
